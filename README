Linux-2.4 can be compiled with tinycc compiler:
- AoT with contained Kbuild.sh
- JiT with https://bellard.org/tcc/tccboot.html

Kbuild.sh contains further comments.
linux-2.4.37 folder contains kernel sources with all necessary patches applied
from patches/kernel folder.

A recent tinycc compiler is required, last tested with mob branch commit
34eed88a70fc8238cd5b623cc96b8bf0e40392ed december 2025.

Currently it is recommended to execute Kbuild.sh on a native x86 build host
instead of using tcc as cross-compiler accross different architectures, because
unknown side-effects could not be confirmed which occured when residing on an
aarch32 buildhost for testing compilation towards x86 target.

With a local test setup the patched linux-2.4.37.11 sources compiled, linked
and too booted successfully including USB, SMP, O1/NPTL, grsecurity support.

A complete i586-tcc-linux2-musl.iso distribution with musl-libc-1.1.24 and
a complete userspace of 500builds including all required development utilities
back-ported onto linux-2.4 SYSV ABI passed self-hosting compilation already:

As introductory note for the conceptual reasoning involved some documentation
is published at a tiny test-site: http://tinyfront.mooo.com/docs.html
